# Machine_Learning
repo for machine learning

None of the work done on any of these projects are totally conslusive, they can actually be extended in lots of ways and i added these 
as comments in some of the files. 

To set up these files you need to have a distribution of anaconda installed
So the steps to having this projects run successfully will include:

1. Make sure anaconda is installed or install it
2. Clone/download the repo
3. Unzip the files on to a chosen location on your computer
4. Open up anaconda and access the files in this project through the browser anaconda shoots up (which should be your default browser)
5. Make sure that the needed libraries are all installed on your chosen environment and then you are ready to go.



Cheers!!!
